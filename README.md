# Stock-Market-Prediction
Description: This program uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a corporation (Apple Inc.) using the past 60 day stock price.

Challenges: the fluctuation in the market is not only dependent on the previous data, it usually changes its trends based on the current market and lot other factors.

Problem Statement : We will write a python program that predicts the price of stocks
using a machine learning technique called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Step 1: import the libraries that will be used throughout this program.

Step 2: get the stock quote for the company ‘Apple Inc.’ using the companies stock ticker (AAPL).


Step 3: split the dataset
the training data set to contain about 80% of the data.
the testing data set to contain about 20% of the data.


Step 4: create Training data set

Step 5: Build the LSTM network model
